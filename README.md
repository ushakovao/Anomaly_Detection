IA models to  implement:

Deep Autoencoders:
Use Deep Autoencoders to model the normal behavior of GameStopâ€™s stock data (price and volume) over time. 
Once trained, any significant deviation from the normal data will be flagged as an anomaly.

Input: Normalized stock prices, trading volumes and possibly the VIX data.
Output: Anomalies (e.g., unusual price movements, abnormal volume spikes).

Gaussian Process Models (GPM):
Gaussian Process Models to detect non-linear trends and uncertainties in time-series data. 
GPM is used to model the distribution of stock prices.
Anomalies can be detected when the observed data points fall far from the predicted distribution.

Input: Historical stock prices and volumes, potentially augmented with VIX data as a feature.
Output: Predicted values vs. observed values. Anomalies are detected when observed data deviates significantly from predictions.
